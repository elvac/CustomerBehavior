### Project Brief
The Instacart as an online grocery store was considering different marketing strategies for variety of customers. In order to apply precise marketing campaigns to targeted customers, the project aimed that conducting analysis for customer segmentation based on customer purchasing behavior data. The analysis outputs would be able to answer specific questions from client's marketing department to clarify customers with different attributes and give recommendations.

### Data Set
The data would be a number of open-source data sets from Instacart, including over 3 million rows of order data, customer information (gender, age, marital status, and income), product information.  
**Challenges:** Datasets had duplicates, missing and inconsistent values.  
**Limitations:** The data lacked purchasing quantity of each item which was a vital attribute of customer behavior. The data was sourced from 2017 which lacked  latest data so that customer behaviors might lag behind over time.


### Project Understanding and Analytical Methods

In this project, the relevant data sets had more than 3 million rows of order data and order details, as well as customer detailed information. Hence, the analytical process would be used Python to **derive variables** to tag for customer purchasing behaviors and profiles. Subsequently, used **aggregation** and **visualizing** to compare how the behaviors were related to customer profiles. The derived variables were as below:

### Outputs
The outcome of the data analysis told what kinds of customer attributes were sensitive to distinguish different purchasing behaviors. Finally, answered clientâ€™s specific questions and gave recommendations. The outputs included Excel files for the analytical process and the aforementioned project outcome.
